## How to get it?

Open up VS Code, go search for the extension "Jest"

## How to get it set up?

This project has the expectation that you would run something like `npm run test` which _just_ looks like `jest` in the `package.json`. So, please keep your configuration inside the `package.json` as opposed to using command line arguments.

Also, you will need to use Jest 17+.

## Want to Contribute?

```js
git clone https://github.com/orta/vscode-jest
cd vscode-jest
npm install
code .
```

Then inside VS Code, hit "Run" and it will open a new VS Code window with the new compiled example üëç.
