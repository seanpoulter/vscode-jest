A comprehensive experience when using [Facebook's Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest) within a project.

* Useful IDE based Feedback
* Session based test watching

## Features

* Starts Jest automatically when you're in a project with Jest installed.
* Show individual fail / passes inline.
* Show fails inside the problem inspector.
* Highlights the errors next to the `expect` functions.
* Adds syntax highlighting to snapshot files.
* A one button update for failed snapshots.

## How to get it?

Open up VS Code, go search for the extension "Jest"

## How to get it set up?

This project has the expectation that you would run something like `npm run test` which _just_ looks like `jest` in the `package.json`. So, please keep your configuration inside the `package.json` as opposed to using command line arguments.

Also, you should use Jest 17+, however 16 works - it will just offer a warning.

## Want to Contribute?

```js
git clone https://github.com/orta/vscode-jest
cd vscode-jest
npm install
code .
```

ATM it's a little bit complicated to contribute, as I'm moving the core code into facebook/jest - so things you may want to add might need to have code shipped to there first. We're still working on the details of how all that can work.

Then inside VS Code, hit "Run" and it will open a new VS Code window with the new compiled example üëç.
